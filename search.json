    "text": "Summary\nAt the end of 2021 the global open access level for research published in 2020 reached 49% with an increase of 3% compared to outputs published in 2019. Access provided through publisher websites increased by 3% to 42% for 2019 publications.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nAccess through other platforms was 21% in 2020 with no growth compared to 2019 publications. This may be the result of embargos depressing rates of access through repositories for the most recent years of publication. Zero-embargo access through non-publisher platforms for 2020 was 32% of all outputs available through other platforms. Future reports will track the evolution of immediate other platform open access over time."

European countries tend to show higher levels of open access through other platforms, compared to other countries with high levels of accessibility and this is in part due to generally shorter embargos, particularly in north-western Europe."
